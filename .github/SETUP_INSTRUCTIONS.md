# Quick Start: Setting Up Branch Protection

## What Was Done

This pull request adds the necessary configuration files to enable branch protection for your repository. Here's what was added:

### 1. CODEOWNERS File
- Location: `.github/CODEOWNERS`
- Purpose: Specifies that all files require approval from @BnB-GSorg
- Effect: When branch protection is enabled, all pull requests will require your approval

### 2. Branch Protection Setup Guide
- Location: `.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md`
- Purpose: Comprehensive guide on configuring GitHub branch protection
- Contains: Step-by-step instructions with recommended settings

### 3. Pull Request Template
- Location: `.github/pull_request_template.md`
- Purpose: Provides a template for contributors when creating pull requests
- Effect: Ensures all PRs have consistent information

### 4. Updated README
- Added a section explaining the access control workflow
- Links to the branch protection setup guide

## What You Need to Do Next

### Step 1: Merge This Pull Request
Once you merge this PR, the CODEOWNERS file will be active in your repository.

### Step 2: Configure Branch Protection on GitHub
**This is the critical step!** The files in this PR prepare your repository, but you must manually enable branch protection on GitHub:

1. Go to: https://github.com/BnB-GSorg/URFallTraining2025/settings/branches
2. Click "Add rule" or "Add classic branch protection rule"
3. Enter branch name: `main` (or your default branch)
4. Enable these settings:
   - ✅ **Require a pull request before merging**
     - Set "Required approvals" to at least 1
     - ✅ **Require review from Code Owners**
   - ✅ **Do not allow bypassing the above settings**
5. Click "Create" or "Save changes"

### Step 3: Test It Works
1. Try to push directly to main - it should be rejected
2. Create a test branch, make a change, and open a PR
3. Verify that the PR requires your approval

## Result

Once configured, here's what will happen:
- ❌ Nobody can push directly to the main branch (including you)
- ✅ All changes must go through pull requests
- ✅ You must approve all pull requests before they can be merged
- ✅ Contributors can still create branches and make changes
- ✅ You maintain full control over what gets merged

## Important Notes

⚠️ **The CODEOWNERS file alone does NOT protect your branch** - you must configure branch protection settings on GitHub as described in Step 2 above.

✅ Once branch protection is enabled, you have complete control over what gets merged into your protected branches.
